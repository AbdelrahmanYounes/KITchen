# KITchen

KITchen is a real-world benchmark and dataset for 6D object pose estimation in kitchen environments. It addresses the challenges of mobile manipulation tasks in diverse kitchen settings, such as retrieving objects from shelves, sinks, dishwashers, and more.

The code for the annotation pipeline will be published soon.
